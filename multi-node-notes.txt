6 Node OpenStack installation:

Deploy - Performs the openstack deployment using openstack-ansible.
Infrastructure - MySQL, RabbitMQ, HAProxy, Memcache.
Controller - All openstack controller software, including keystone, horizon, nova, heat.
Network - Openstack networking components, has the layer 3 routing and neutron.
Compute - Openstack compute node, runs the VMs.
Storage - Runs cinder and swift storage, iSCSI block storage.

Use packer to provision the base machines.

Have a python script generate the network configuration files and the openstack-ansible yaml files
required for installation. Static IP addresses should be assigned here, to be passed in to the script
when it's run.

The python script will also validate particular things to make sure the environment is ready
to have an installation done.

Once the python script is successful, tell the user where to SSH to and what commands to run to begin the
installation.
